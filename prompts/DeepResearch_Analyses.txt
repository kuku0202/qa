## Molecular Representation
Purpose: Encode molecules for computational analysis and generation.
SMILES/SELFIES: Use linear string representations for input/output in sequence models.
Graph Representations: Atoms as nodes, bonds as edges; used in graph neural networks (GNNs).
Molecular Fingerprints: Transform molecules into lower-dimensional vectors, Use for similarity, clustering and diversity analysis.
3D Coordinates: Cartesian coordinates for 3D-aware models and docking.
Descriptors: Physicochemical properties (e.g., logP, MW, TPSA) as features.

## Generative Model Construction
Purpose: Build models to generate novel, valid, and preferred feature molecules.
Variational Autoencoders(VAE): Encode molecules into a latent space and decode to generate new ones.
GANs: Compete generator/discriminator for realistic molecule creation.
Reinforcement Learning: Use reward functions to bias generation toward desired properties.
Language Models: Use transformers, LSTMs, or GPT-like models for sequence-based like SMILES/SELFIES generation.
Graph-based Generators: Directly generate molecular graphs using GNNs or graph-based VAEs.

## Property Prediction
Purpose: Predict and evaluate chemical, physical, and biological properties of molecules.
QSAR Models: Predict activity or properties using machine learning (RF, XGBoost, DNNs).
ADMET Prediction: Predict Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity.
Docking/Scoring: Predict binding affinity to protein targets using molecular docking.
Physicochemical Properties: Calculate logP, MW, H-bond donors/acceptors, TPSA, etc.
Uncertainty Estimation: Quantify prediction confidence using ensembles or Bayesian methods.

## Molecular Optimization
Purpose: Improve generated molecules for multiple objectives.
Multi-objective Optimization: Simultaneously optimize for potency, selectivity, and drug-likeness.
Bayesian Optimization: Efficiently search latent or chemical space for optimal molecules.
Genetic Algorithms/Evolutionary Strategies: Evolve populations of molecules via mutation/crossover.
Gradient-based Optimization: Use differentiable models to optimize molecular representations.

## Diversity, Novelty, and Redundancy Assessment
Purpose: Ensure generated molecules are novel, diverse, and non-redundant.
Diversity Metrics: Tanimoto similarity, scaffold diversity, internal diversity.
Novelty Checks: Compare to known molecules in ChEMBL, ZINC, or internal libraries.
Redundancy Removal: Cluster and filter out near-duplicates.

## Synthetic Accessibility and Filtering
Purpose: Assess and filter molecules for synthetic feasibility and safety.
Synthetic Accessibility Score (SAS): Predict ease of synthesis.
Retrosynthetic Analysis: Use tools (ASKCOS, AiZynthFinder) to propose synthetic routes.
Rule-based Filtering: Remove molecules with PAINS, toxicophores, or reactive groups.
Drug-likeness Filters: Apply Lipinski, Veber, Ghose, or other rules.

## Benchmarking and Validation
Purpose: Evaluate generative model performance and compare to baselines.

Validity: Fraction of chemically valid molecules generated.
Uniqueness: Fraction of unique molecules among generated set.
Novelty: Fraction not present in training data.
Fr√©chet ChemNet Distance (FCD): Compare distribution of generated molecules to real molecules.
GuacaMol/ MOSES Benchmarks: Standardized benchmarks for molecular generation.

## Visualization and Interpretation
Purpose: Visualize molecules, properties, and model outputs for interpretation.
2D/3D Structure Plots: Visualize molecules using RDKit, PyMOL, or NGLView.
Property Distribution Plots: Histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps of predicted properties.
Latent Space Visualization: Use t-SNE, UMAP, or PCA to visualize learned molecular embeddings.
Similarity Maps: Highlight substructures contributing to property predictions.

## Explainability and Attribution
Purpose: Understand model decisions and highlight important molecular features.
Feature Attribution: Use SHAP, LIME, or attention weights to interpret predictions.
