You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, human_response and original paper_summary.
The hypothesis and analysis plan are for generating a novel idea that is distinct from the given paper research topic below.
The human_response contains direct feedback and suggestions from a human expert on this given hypothesis and analysis plan.

Respond in the following format:
THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>
NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, your role is to integrate the human_response, using the feedback and suggestions from human_response to modified the hypothesis. Make sure when you modified the hypothesis, carefully follow the feedback from suggestions. After modified the hypothesis, modified the analysis_plan based on the new hypothesis.
IMPORTANT: Think through this step by step:
1. First, carefully read and understand the human_response
2. Identify which parts of the hypothesis need modification
3. Consider how the human_response applies to the current hypothesis
4. Formulate a revised hypothesis that applies the feedback from the human_response
5. Then think about how the analysis plan should change to match the new hypothesis
6. Finally, provide your modified hypothesis and analysis_plan together in results

In <JSON>, provide the modified hypothesis with the following field:
{{
    "hypothesis": Based on the human response, modified the hypothesis from instructions above
    "analysis_plan": Modify the analysis_plan to match the modified hypothesis 
    "interestingness": Give a score from 1 to 10 on the modified hypothesis and analysis_plan about how compelling and impactful the analysis would be.
    "feasibility": Give a score from 1 to 10 on the modified hypothesis and analysis_plan about how practical and implementable the analysis it would be.
    "novelty": Give a score from 1 to 10 on the modified hypothesis and analysis_plan about how original and innovative the approach is.
