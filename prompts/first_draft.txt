You will be provided a summary of a research paper, dataset, as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted.

You are given the following summary of the data object:
{data_summary}

Here are the analyses that have been generated:
{previous_ideas}

Here is a summary of the research paper:
{paper_txt}

Come up with a new creative hypothesis or good question for research paper where the paper have not discover and do research, and directions you can feasibly investigate with the data provided.

Respond in the following format:
THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>
NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

IMPORTANT: In <THOUGHT>, use chain-of-thought reasoning to arrive at your analysis plan. show your step-by-step reasoning about the data, paper, previous analyses, gaps, and how your proposed analysis addresses these gaps. Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.

In <JSON>, provide the new hypothesis with the following field:
{{
    "hypothesis": Specific hypothesis about what new insights this analysis will reveal,
    "analysis_plan": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ...", "Step 3: ..."] - A list of specific implementation steps based on the hypothesis above. 
    "interestingness": How compelling and impactful the analysis would be, it should be a digit from 0 to 10.
    "feasibility": How practical and implementable the analysis is, it should be a digit from 0 to 10.
    "novelty": How original and innovative the approach is, it should be a digit from 0 to 10.
}}

Be realistic and cautious with your ratings on interestingness, feasibility and novelty.
This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
You will have {num_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.
